1.Data Abstractions
VertexRDD
Edge
EdgeRDD
EdgeTriple
Graph


2.VertexRDD
Each vertex is represented by a key-value pair, where the key is a unique id and value is the data
associated with a vertex.

3.Edge
#The Edge class abstracts a directed edge in a property graph
#An instance of the Edge class contains source vertex id, destination 
#vertex id and edge attributes

4.EdgeRDD
EdgeRDD represents a distributed collection of the edges in a property graph

5.EdgeTriplet
An instance of the EdgeTriplet class represents a combination of an edge and the two vertices

6.EdgeContext
The EdgeContext class combines EdgeTriplet with methods to send messages to source and 
destination vertices of an edge

7.Graph
#Graph is GraphXâ€™s abstraction for representing property graphs
#It recreates a partition on a different machine if a machine fails.

#The Graph class provides methods for modifying not only the vertex and edge attributes 
but also the structure of a property graph
